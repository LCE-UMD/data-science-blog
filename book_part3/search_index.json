But in human and animal research, there are two forms of variability that are inherently distinct: within-participant and between-participant. Let’s explore some of the reasons to keep track of where variability comes from. (Before that let’s pause for a second to think why keeping track of these might appear to not matter. Suppose you have a group of observations \\(A\\) (of any kind) and a separate group of observartions B. So if you take the average of A, \\(\\bar{x}_A\\), and the average of \\(B\\), \\(\\bar{x}_B\\), the overall average \\(\\bar{x}_{A,B}\\) is the same as \\(\\frac{1}{2}( \\bar{x}_A + \\bar{x}_B)\\). This is simply because the “average of the averages” is the same as the “average of everything individually,” a convenient property of things that combine linearly.) Back to within-participant and between-participant variability. Suppose the observations \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) come from two separate sets of participants. We could see how different the “typical” responses to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are by calculating \\(\\bar{x}_A-\\bar{x}_B\\). Now suppose you have multiple observations \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) from the same participant, and that you have, as typical, multiple participants. In this case, you have a richer scenario because each participant has multiple data points for \\(A\\) and multiple data points for \\(B\\). You capitalize upon that nested structure in the following way. If you summarize the typical response to manipulation \\(A\\) as \\(\\bar{x}_A\\) and to manipulation \\(B\\) as \\(\\bar{x}_B\\) for subject \\(1\\), then \\(\\bar{x}_A-\\bar{x}_B\\) represents the difference score within that subject. You can do the same for all other participants. Now, if you are interested in how \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) differ, you can look at difference scores defined within participants and see how they are distributed across participants. What this does for you is to remove the subject effect, and allows you to focus on the treatment effect A vs. B. So if subject \\(1\\) is, for example, a “fast responder”&quot; (say fast reaction times in general), the fact that \\(B\\) is associated with a larger mean than \\(A\\) is not masked by across-individual variability in baseline responding. The figure below illustrates the situation. There’s a consistent treatment effect from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) within subject, but that will only be clear if you eliminate across-participant variability. Figure 1.1: Within-subject differences studied across participants. \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) represent the two conditions of interest. The bottom gray line indicates the range of responding from \\(150\\) to \\(650\\) (say, reaction times in milliseconds), and arbitrary low, medium, and high respoding zones (L, M, and H). The small purple lines are individual trials, and the thicker line is the mean for that condition. Conclusion: When you have within-participant data think about the object of interest as difference scores. You have a much better way to estimate differences, so forget about \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) individually and think of \\(A-B\\). "],
["between-participant-estimates.html", "Chapter 2 Between-participant estimates", " Chapter 2 Between-participant estimates In Chapter 1 (Withing- and between-participant variability), we discussed the follwing idea: You might have a much better way to estimate differences, so forget about \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) individually and think of \\(A-B\\). But does this mean that you should not estimate \\(A\\) and/or \\(B\\)? The answer to this quesion is entirely determined by your subject matter, as it might be extremely important to estimate them individually. All we said in Chapter 13 is that you have a much better chance to estimate \\(A-B\\) in some scenarios. The field of statistics focuses on two main interrelated goals: (1) Estimating properties from data; and (2) Understanding the distributional properties of the estimates. Goal (2) usually takes place in the context of attempting to draw statistical inferences, but it needn’t be. So if understading properties about \\(A\\) is what your research calls for, go ahead and estimate it. But when you estimate it, never forget (2) even if your focus at that point is not on making inferences. In other words, estimate some property of \\(A\\), say \\(\\bar{x}_A\\), but don’t stop there. Study how \\(A\\) is distributed. Let’s work through a simple example. Consider that your goal is to estimate the representative value of \\(A\\) (something like the mean, median, or mode). Here, \\(A\\) is a strange object of interest: “the neural trajectory in time when someone is under threat in a given experiment”. The goal of using this unusual object is to illustrate that the principle applies very generally, no matter what property you want to understand from your data. When you estimate the representative value of \\(A\\), that’s a single value (or object in our case): that’s what statisticians call a point estimate. The problem is that while it might have great pratical and theoretical properties, the representative \\(A\\) is just that, a single thing. So you need to characterize how \\(A\\) is distributed. When you look at the distribution of your estimate of \\(A\\), you might find that it’s so variable as to defy utility (Figure 7.1). Figure 2.1: Estimates of a property of the data your interested in: in this case the trajectory shown in (A). (B) Based on the estimator that you’re using, the individual-level trajectories are incredibly variable. The (putatively) representative trajectory is clearly a very poor indicator of your object of study. In other words, based on data at hand, you do not have a good way of understanding what \\(A\\) is really about. But this is something that you should report, not hide. Why? Because that becomes a problem for a future study: designing a study in which \\(A\\) can be better understood. Based on your investigation, although you can’t estimate it well, you might gain multiple insights into doing this in the future. So this is very important. Your investigations are as much about “now” as the future of your research. "]
